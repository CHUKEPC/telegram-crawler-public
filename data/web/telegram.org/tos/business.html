  <div id="dev_page_content"><p>Telegram is a free application that provides a wide range of services for both individuals and businesses, including cloud storage, chat management features, support for multiple devices and more, at no cost. Some additional services, such as <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-business">Telegram Business</a>, may be available for purchase in certain countries – offering features built to help companies improve their communication with customers, while supporting the continued development of the Telegram platform.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="1-introduction" href="#1-introduction"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Telegram Business is a subscription membership that unlocks exclusive features and improved functionality like automated messages, quick replies, profile customization and chatbot integration. By purchasing Telegram Business, you agree that you are authorizing recurring monthly or yearly payments, which will be made to Telegram using the payment method you selected until the subscription is canceled by you or Telegram.</p>
<p>Telegram uses third-party payment processors to securely facilitate purchases of Telegram Business.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="1-1-payment" href="#1-1-payment"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1.1. Payment</h4>
<p>You can manage your Telegram Business subscription by accessing the Telegram Business section in the Settings of your Telegram account. If your payment method is declined, you must provide new payment information or your Telegram Business subscription will be canceled. If you provide new payment information and are successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="1-2-taxes-and-conversion-rates" href="#1-2-taxes-and-conversion-rates"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1.2. Taxes and Conversion Rates</h4>
<p>Users in certain regions may be required to pay local taxes, which will be calculated and added to the total cost of a purchase. Payment providers may apply their own commissions and conversion rates to payments in various currencies. This is outside of Telegram’s control.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-cancellation-policy" href="#2-cancellation-policy"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Cancellation Policy</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="2-1-canceling-a-subscription" href="#2-1-canceling-a-subscription"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.1. Canceling a Subscription</h4>
<p>You can cancel Telegram Business any time. To cancel your subscription, follow the instructions in the Telegram Business section in the Settings of your Telegram account. If you purchased Telegram Business using your Apple ID, you can cancel your subscription through your device&#39;s Account Settings or in the Manage Subscriptions section of the Apple App Store. If you purchased Telegram Business using Google Play, you can cancel your subscriptions by visiting the Subscriptions section of Google Play.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="2-2-refunds-and-effective-cancellation" href="#2-2-refunds-and-effective-cancellation"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.2. Refunds and Effective Cancellation</h4>
<p>Your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the end of your current billing period, and you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period. At the end of your subscription you will lose access to all features associated with Telegram Business.</p>
<p>Deleting your Telegram account or removing the Telegram application from your device does not cancel your subscription.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="3-paid-services-obtained-through-third-parties" href="#3-paid-services-obtained-through-third-parties"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3. Paid Services Obtained Through Third Parties</h3>
<p>If you obtain a Telegram Business subscription via a third party (e.g. Google Play, Apple App Store), your purchase may be further subject to the third party&#39;s terms as agreed between you and the third party. For paid services obtained via a third party, your billing relationship will be directly with the applicable third party.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="3-1-refunding-services-obtained-through-third-parties" href="#3-1-refunding-services-obtained-through-third-parties"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3.1. Refunding Services Obtained Through Third Parties</h4>
<p>By issuing a chargeback or refund request for Business subscriptions paid for through a third party, you agree to allow Telegram to release necessary data to that third party regarding your account status and Telegram Business subscriptions.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="4-termination" href="#4-termination"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Termination</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-1-compliance-with-the-terms" href="#4-1-compliance-with-the-terms"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.1. Compliance with the Terms</h4>
<p>Failure to comply with the Telegram Terms of Service may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from Telegram or some of its services. In such instances, you might lose the benefits of Telegram Business and we will not compensate you for this loss.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-2-unilateral-termination" href="#4-2-unilateral-termination"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.2. Unilateral Termination</h4>
<p>Telegram can decide to stop offering subscriptions at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, or to comply with a legal requirement; in this case we will cancel your subscription and refund the prorated portion of any prepaid subscription fee equal to the remaining unused term of the subscription.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="5-taxes-fees-and-refunds" href="#5-taxes-fees-and-refunds"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5. Taxes, Fees and Refunds</h3>
<p>You are responsible for all applicable taxes, data plans, internet fees, and other fees associated with your use of Telegram.</p>
<p>Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable. It is not possible to get a “partial refund” or credit if a user wishes to cancel their recurring subscription early – it will remain valid until the end of its purchased duration.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-changes" href="#6-changes"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6. Changes</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-1-pricing-and-terms" href="#6-1-pricing-and-terms"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1. Pricing and Terms</h4>
<p>During the initial phase following its launch, Telegram Business shall be provided complimentary to subscribers of Telegram Premium. Subsequently, we reserve the right to institute a separate charge for Telegram Business services.</p>
<p>While we do not anticipate frequent changes to the price of Telegram Business, we reserve the right to change both these terms and the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription, to reflect factors such as changes to our business, different product offerings, or new economic conditions.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="6-2-advance-notice" href="#6-2-advance-notice"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2. Advance Notice</h4>
<p>We will give you no less than 30 days&#39; advance notice of any material changes via a message to your Telegram account and you will have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new fee comes into effect. Any correspondence from Telegram about a user’s Business account will be sent via verified service accounts in the Telegram app.</p>
<p>Messages from Telegram about your Business account will contain relevant information about your subscription or payment status – not special offers or promotions.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-the-scope-of-business-services" href="#7-the-scope-of-business-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7. The Scope of Business Services</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-1-included-services" href="#7-1-included-services"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.1. Included Services</h4>
<p>The services included in the Telegram Business subscription (“Business Services”) are listed in the Business Section in official Telegram apps. From time to time, we may add new items into the Business Services. We may also remove some of the existing Business Services if we are no longer able to provide them for legal or technical reasons. In addition, some Business Services may become free of charge for all Telegram users in the future or be offered as a separate membership tier.</p>
<p>At times, certain Telegram Business features may be included in or bundled with other offerings, such as <a href="https://telegram.org/tos#terms-of-service-for-telegram-premium">Telegram Premium</a>. In such cases, your use of Telegram Business will be further subject to the relevant Terms of those offerings.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-2-availability" href="#7-2-availability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.2. Availability</h4>
<p>Telegram strives to make its services available for all users all the time, but occasional technical issues may occur, temporarily preventing us from delivering services, including Business Services, to our users. Telegram will not compensate you for any direct or indirect loss resulting from our temporary inability to provide any free or paid services.</p>
<p>Business Services are available on major Telegram clients, such as the official iOS and Android apps. Some Telegram apps made by Telegram or by third parties may not offer all Business Services immediately after they are launched or at all.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-3-software-requirements" href="#7-3-software-requirements"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.3. Software Requirements</h4>
<p>Some Business Services may require the latest version of the Telegram application to be installed on your device. In some cases, users you interact with may also need to have the latest version of the Telegram application installed on their devices in order to be able to view the content you share with them by the use of Business Services. For example, the location and business hours you add to your profile may be correctly viewed only by users with an up-to-date version of Telegram.</p>
<p>In general, users you interact with will not have to purchase a Telegram Business subscription in order to view the content you share with them by the use of Business Services.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-4-automated-messages" href="#7-4-automated-messages"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.4. Automated Messages</h4>
<p>Business services include the optional ability to set up automated responses that are sent to users who contact you, within certain parameters that you specify. We will take every effort to ensure this feature works as expected, however, technical errors or factors outside our control (e.g., hardware or network issues) may cause some messages to be delivered incorrectly, or not be delivered at all. </p>
<p>In the event that any messages are not delivered exactly as you had intended, either due to an error or to incorrect parameters, Telegram will not be liable and will not compensate any losses, direct or indirect, that you or your business might incur.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="7-5-chatbot-integration" href="#7-5-chatbot-integration"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.5. Chatbot Integration</h4>
<p>Telegram Business users can connect a chatbot to their account, to streamline and automate interactions between their business and clients. This enables a designated third-party bot from the Telegram Bot Platform to receive and optionally send messages on behalf of the Business user&#39;s account. By using the Chatbot Integration feature, you expressly acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to <a href="/privacy#6-5-telegram-business-chatbots">section 6.5.</a> of our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and to <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bots#4-3-telegram-business">section 4.3.</a> of our <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bots">Bot Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>It must be stressed that bots on the Telegram Bot Platform <strong>are not</strong> created or maintained by Telegram – they are owned and operated by independent third parties. Accordingly, the reliability, accuracy and availability of the Chatbot Integration feature depends on the third-party service provider that maintains the specific bot you choose, and your usage of their service may further be subject to the third party&#39;s terms as agreed between you and them.</p>
<p>Telegram takes every precaution to protect your privacy and your account, including mandating that bot developers agree to strict <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers">Terms of Service</a> that detail how they must safeguard any data you give them and transparently describe their services. However, we cannot guarantee that this feature will always be available or work as intended, or that the third-party service will perform in good faith or exactly as you expect. We encourage you to always verify the reliability of the bot you choose, and to perform all necessary tests to ensure it works as intended.</p>
