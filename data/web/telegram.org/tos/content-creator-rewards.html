  <h1 id="dev_page_title">Terms of Service for Content Creators</h1>
  
  <div id="dev_page_content"><p>Telegram provides a free and secure messaging service. In addition to sending private messages, Telegram users can subscribe to public one-to-many channels. Creators who use Telegram channels to host and publish content may be eligible to receive rewards from ads displayed in their channel, proceeds from sponsored posts they publish and donations of Telegram Stars from their subscribers.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your usage of the Content Creator Rewards Program <strong>(“Content Creator Rewards”, “Rewards Program”)</strong> provided by Telegram Messenger Inc. <strong>(“Telegram”)</strong> and constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Telegram. For the purposes of these terms, <strong>‘we’</strong>, <strong>‘us’</strong> and <strong>‘our’</strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’</strong> refers to you, the user participating as a content creator.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="1-acceptance-of-content-creator-terms" href="#1-acceptance-of-content-creator-terms"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Acceptance of Content Creator Terms</h3>
<p>By publishing content on Telegram channels and accepting rewards, you agree that you have read in full, understood and accepted to be legally bound by the terms contained herein, in addition to <a href="/tos">Telegram’s Terms of Service</a> and <a href="/privacy">Telegram’s Privacy Policy</a>. All of the aforementioned terms may be amended from time to time at our discretion, and updated versions enter into force as soon as they are published at their respective web-pages. </p>
<p>For clarity, your continued participation in Rewards Program shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms and all other terms that are incorporated herein, including any updates or modifications to them from time to time.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-scope" href="#2-scope"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Scope</h3>
<p>These terms govern your participation in Rewards Program, which is in no way to be viewed or represented as a form of employment or partnership with Telegram, nor as an endorsement by Telegram of you, your associates, agents, employers, channels, opinions, or the content you publish.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-1-advertisement-revenue-sharing" href="#2-1-advertisement-revenue-sharing"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.1. Advertisement Revenue Sharing</h3>
<p>Advertisers can use our <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/">Ad Platform</a> to purchase ads that will be published on Telegram in the form of sponsored messages. By default, ads are shown in suitable channels chosen by the advertiser. </p>
<p>You may be eligible to receive a reward corresponding to a 50% share of the revenue Telegram earns in connection with the number of valid impressions of sponsored messages displayed in eligible channels you own, subject to Telegram’s ongoing voluntary commitment to incentivizing content creators who comply with the terms set out in this agreement. The share, if any, is subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion.Telegram will determine the amount of your reward and means of withdrawal at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that such rewards do not constitute payments for any services rendered, represent an optional good-faith effort by Telegram to incentivize content creators, and may be waived or discontinued at any time.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-2-paid-content" href="#2-2-paid-content"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.2. Paid Content</h3>
<p>Owners of eligible Telegram channels may choose to monetize individual posts, making their contents hidden unless readers offer a certain number of Telegram Stars to unlock them. The owners may then receive <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#6-2-4-rewards-for-stars">an equivalent of 0.013 USD worth of rewards</a> from Telegram for each Star they earned with paid posts.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="2-2-1-access-to-purchased-content" href="#2-2-1-access-to-purchased-content"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.2.1. Access to Purchased Content</h4>
<p>Telegram will take all reasonable technical precautions to prevent users from downloading, screenshotting or otherwise redistributing paid contents they purchase from you. This fact notwithstanding, you acknowledge and agree that Telegram cannot completely eliminate the risk of unauthorized distribution by a skilled actor, and you assume the risk that your paid content may be saved or redistributed without your permission.</p>
<p>Inside Telegram apps, users who paid to unlock a post published on your channel can continue to access it even if you delete the original post or the entire channel. The same is true if you remove the user from your channel or they unsubscribe from it, in which case they will continue to have access to the original post from their transaction history, but will not be able to view other posts you publish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can learn more about how this content is stored in <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#3-3-5-paid-posts">Section 3.3.5</a> of our Privacy Policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-3-subscriber-donations" href="#2-3-subscriber-donations"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2.3. Subscriber Donations</h3>
<p>Owners of eligible Telegram channels can enable users to support them by donating Stars through a dedicated Star reaction to their posts. The owners may then receive a reward from Telegram based on the number of Stars they have received as donations.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="3-availability" href="#3-availability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3. Availability</h3>
<p>The Telegram Rewards Program may be partially or fully unavailable to certain channels, channel owners and geographical regions, in accordance with current demand, economic considerations, regulatory restrictions, channel topics and other factors. Similarly, advertisements and the ability to purchase or spend Stars may not be visible or available for users in certain regions, which, at times, could represent a significant portion of your audience.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of Rewards Program for both you, your channels and your audience may change at any time, and we are not obligated to provide advance notice, compensation or explanations for any such changes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="4-rewards" href="#4-rewards"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Rewards</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-1-balance" href="#4-1-balance"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.1. Balance</h4>
<p>You may use your accrued <strong>Star balance</strong> to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/mini-app-bar-paid-media-and-more?ln=f#subsidized-ads-for-creators-and-developers">place Telegram advertisements</a> or <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/mini-app-bar-paid-media-and-more?ln=f#rewards-for-content-creators-and-developers">accept rewards</a>, and you may withdraw your accrued balance. You understand and agree that any pending balance shown in your Telegram channel, until requested for withdrawal, used to receive rewards or place ads and successfully transferred, does not constitute funds owned by you and held in deposit or under custody by Telegram on your behalf. This displayed balance should be considered an indicative amount representing the rewards you may receive pursuant to the provisions set out herein under our content creator program. The Telegram platform is not and does not act as a financial institution or custodian of these funds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, without limiting <a href="#4-4-receiving-rewards">4.4.</a>, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the timely withdrawal of your accrued rewards. We reserve the right to impose an expiration date on your unredeemed rewards at our sole discretion, after which they will be considered forfeit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For technical reasons, Toncoin balance rewards become available for withdrawal 2 days after the date they were accrued, while Star balance rewards require 21 days. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-2-value" href="#4-2-value"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.2. Value</h4>
<p>Official Telegram clients may display an estimated value of your balances in a global currency, such as USD or EUR. You understand and agree that the estimated value displayed is for convenience only, is purely an approximation relevant for a particular moment in time and not a guaranteed price or exchange offer. The relative value of your channel balance may fluctuate over time, and we make no guarantee that any cryptocurrency will retain or increase its value over time in relation to other global currencies. Similarly, Telegram determines the monetary value it assigns to Stars in its sole discretion, and this value has no connection, direct or implied, to the historical, present, or anticipated future purchase cost of Stars in any particular region. You acknowledge that both the Star purchase cost and the monetary value Telegram assigns to them for the purposes of rewards may fluctuate over time, based on current market conditions, economic considerations and other factors. We do not anticipate frequent changes to the monetary value assigned to Stars for the purpose of issuing rewards.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-3-advertising-with-stars" href="#4-3-advertising-with-stars"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.3. Advertising with Stars</h4>
<p>You can use Stars earned by your channel to place Telegram advertisements for that specific channel, provided that the contents it hosts or displays, along with the name and branding of the channel itself are in compliance with the <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/guidelines">Telegram Ad Policies and Guidelines</a>. You understand and agree that by placing Telegram Ads for your channel you are further subject to the <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/tos">Telegram Ad Platform Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>When used for Telegram Ads, each Star in your balance is worth 0.02 USD in advertising credit. It is possible that this value may fluctuate, based on temporary promotions and incentives, or to address market conditions, economic factors and other events.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-4-receiving-rewards" href="#4-4-receiving-rewards"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.4. Receiving Rewards</h4>
<p>You may choose to receive rewards from Telegram based on the Toncoin and Star balances accrued in your channel. Telegram currently outsources the processing of all Content Creator Rewards to <a href="https://fragment.com/">Fragment</a>, a non-custodial platform owned and operated by Fragment Corp. You understand and agree that your engagement with Fragment is further subject to the Fragment <a href="https://fragment.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://fragment.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Fragment may be unable to issue rewards for certain users or in certain countries, in accordance with regulatory considerations and other factors. Likewise, your government, internet service provider or other relevant authorities may directly or indirectly prevent you from accessing or engaging with Telegram, Telegram Stars or Fragment. All aforementioned factors are outside of our control, therefore, should you for any reason be unable to engage with Fragment, receive rewards, or otherwise ultimately benefit from Stars in the way you had anticipated when publishing content, initiating sales or accepting donations, you understand and agree that Telegram will not be liable, nor will it offer any alternative compensation, refund or reward.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-5-account-management" href="#4-5-account-management"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.5. Account Management</h4>
<p>Channel owners and their administrators are solely responsible for safeguarding, handling and withdrawing any rewards earned by their channel. By accepting these terms, you acknowledge that as the channel owner, you bear all responsibility therein, including but not limited to maintaining access to your Telegram account, enabling security features such as Two-Step Verification, using only official Telegram apps and ensuring your devices are free of malware.</p>
<p>For clarity, should you lose access to your account or channel, thereby becoming unable to withdraw any pending balance or accept rewards for Stars stored therein, all connected balances are considered forfeit and Telegram will not compensate you for this loss. Similarly, any reward withdrawals are neither reversible nor refundable, including but not limited to instances where you may erroneously use an incorrect wallet. You understand that it is your responsibility to ensure that your withdrawals are set for the intended destination.</p>
<p>You additionally understand and agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring your continued ability to access your cryptocurrency wallet, and, by extension, any cryptocurrency you own. Neither Telegram nor any other party controls decentralized blockchains, and as such, there exists no mechanism, entity or authority capable of restoring access to your wallets or funds, should you lose access to them for any reason, including but not limited to negligence, malware, technical errors and malicious actors. You must take any necessary steps to safely store the login information, passwords, passphrases and other recovery information related to your wallet, and Telegram will not be liable if you fail to do so, or otherwise lose access to your wallet or funds by any means.</p>
<p>For clarity, you understand and agree that Telegram does not possess the technical means to restore your cryptocurrency wallet and will not refund you any cryptocurrency should you lose access to either one by any means or for any reason.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-6-taxes-and-fees" href="#4-6-taxes-and-fees"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.6. Taxes and Fees</h4>
<p>You are solely responsible for all taxes and fees associated with the income you receive via Rewards Program, if applicable and in accordance with local laws. Telegram will not inform you of, nor calculate or pay out any taxes and fees on your behalf. All payouts you withdraw via Rewards Program are to be considered inclusive of tax. You explicitly acknowledge and agree that Telegram will not be liable for any fees, expenses, penalties, or additional costs you may incur as a result of your participation in Rewards Program, including but not limited to those arising from your failure to properly comply with applicable local laws.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-7-expiration" href="#4-7-expiration"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.7. Expiration</h4>
<p>Stars earned in connection with the content you publish on Telegram are valid for 3 years from the date they were received. Should you fail to accept rewards with the Stars you accrued within their 3 year period of validity, they will be considered forfeit and debited from your balance.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="5-code-of-conduct" href="#5-code-of-conduct"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5. Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>The following details the fundamental code of conduct for all content creators on the Telegram platform. In addition to the stipulations below, you agree to use the Telegram platform in good faith, for the benefit of its users and to enrich the overall Telegram ecosystem. Failure to do so may result in your permanent exclusion from Rewards Program, as well as the termination of your channel and your Telegram account.</p>
<p>Additional local laws and regulations may apply to you and the content you publish on Telegram. It is your responsibility to ensure that your channel, its branding and all content you publish is in full compliance with all applicable legislation, and Telegram will not be liable for any violations.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="5-1-publishing-content-for-rewards" href="#5-1-publishing-content-for-rewards"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5.1. Publishing Content for Rewards</h4>
<p>You acknowledge that Telegram reserves the right to partially or fully withhold your rewards if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have not been in compliance with these terms or other applicable Telegram <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Terms of Service</a> at any point, up to and including the date on which you request withdrawal. </p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that Telegram has the right to offset rewards to you by deducting any amount of Toncoin or Stars it deems related to invalid activity, impressions or queries. The deducted amount can equal the full balance as the case may be. Invalid activity includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Impressions and activity solicited through false representation, monetary purchase or explicit requests for users to interact with sponsored messages for the purposes of artificially inflating Ad revenue share payout;</li>
<li>(b) Spam, phishing, automation, invalid or fake impressions, purchases, donations and any other simulated or otherwise non-genuine activity, regardless of whether operated or solicited by you, your associates or other third parties;</li>
<li>(c) Any impressions or activity generated in a channel (or by a user) that itself did not comply with these Terms or, by extension, with the Telegram <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>;</li>
<li>(d) Attempts to modify or interfere with Telegram clients and APIs, including but not limited to tampering with how Telegram serves ads, measures user impressions, facilitates payments, calculates balances, displays purchase prices and handles donation reactions;</li>
<li>(e) Unauthorized or unlawful purchases, sales facilitated through phishing or scam, or abuse and exploitation of third-party refund systems;</li>
<li>(f) Any other activity facilitated by intentional or otherwise unwanted or illegal misconduct by the channel owner, its audience, other channel administrators or unrelated third parties;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that any such invalid activity is detected after you have withdrawn your balance, Telegram reserves the right to debit your account and offset any future rewards until it is made whole. Depending on the circumstances and at its sole discretion, Telegram may also stop rewarding you based on the revenue originating from your channel, or terminate it and your account altogether.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-unilateral-termination" href="#6-unilateral-termination"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6. Unilateral Termination</h3>
<p>Telegram can decide to fully or partially discontinue its Rewards Program at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. This includes but is not limited to discontinuation in specific regions, for certain users or channels, or for a subset of services and features. For clarity, we make no guarantee of ongoing or continued support for this program. In the event that the program is terminated, any accrued rewards that have not been transferred out of a channel will remain accessible for a period determined at our sole discretion, after which they will be considered forfeit.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that Telegram has complete discretion to terminate your reward from or participation in Rewards Program without warning, for violations of these Terms or of the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram Terms of Service</a> made by your channel, its administrators, or yourself. In such cases, Telegram may temporarily suspend your channel’s participation until the infraction is remedied, or permanently remove you or your channel from the program.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-liability" href="#7-liability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7. Liability</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Telegram shall bear no liability for any unrealized payments, lost or misplaced cryptocurrency, or otherwise unforeseen consequences, financial or otherwise, that you may incur as a direct or indirect consequence of your present or past participation in Rewards Program.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that Telegram has no liability, control, nor responsibility over the cryptocurrency wallets to which you withdraw your earnings. Your relationship with said wallets and their relevant service providers is governed by any applicable Terms of Service between you and the third-party services. Any disputes or concerns that may arise regarding your external cryptocurrency wallets and transfers are to be mediated and resolved solely by yourself and the third party services involved.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-1-indemnity" href="#7-1-indemnity"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.1. Indemnity</h3>
<p>You accept and agree to grant Telegram and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, contractors and employees absolute indemnity and to hold them harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, obligations, investigations, demands, suits, expenses, costs and damages (including but not limited to legal fees, fines or penalties imposed by any authorities, private entities or regulatory institutions) arising from, related to, or in any way incurred as a result of your use of, conduct in connection with, your engagement with, receipt of and access to Rewards Program. For clarity, this indemnity clause complements the rights, privileges and protections already provided to us under the Telegram Terms of Service (if applicable).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-2-services-provided-as-is" href="#7-2-services-provided-as-is"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.2. Services Provided “As Is”</h3>
<p>We undertake all possible efforts to provide the best experience of participating to Rewards Program. However, just like many other electronic services, the program is provided &quot;as is” and “as available”, and we make no guarantees that it always will be error-free, or that it will function without delays and disruptions at all times. We disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="8-changes" href="#8-changes"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>8. Changes</h3>
<p>We will review and may update these Terms from time to time.
