  <h1 id="dev_page_title">Terms of Service for Telegram Advertisement Revenue Sharing</h1>
  
  <div id="dev_page_content"><p>Telegram provides a free and secure messaging service. In addition to sending private messages, Telegram users can subscribe to public one-to-many channels, in which Telegram may display privacy-conscious sponsored messages from time to time.</p>
<p>When sponsored messages appear in an eligible channel, its owner may be rewarded with a share of the advertisement revenue earned by Telegram, pursuant to the provisions below.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your usage of the Advertisement Revenue Sharing Program <strong>(“RS”)</strong> provided by Telegram Messenger Inc. <strong>(“Telegram”)</strong> and constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Telegram. For the purposes of these terms, <strong>‘we’</strong>, <strong>‘us’</strong> and <strong>‘our’</strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’</strong> refers to you, the user participating in RS.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="1-acceptance-of-revenue-sharing-terms" href="#1-acceptance-of-revenue-sharing-terms"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Acceptance of Revenue Sharing Terms</h3>
<p>By benefiting from RS, you agree that you have read in full, understood and accepted to be legally bound by the terms contained herein, in addition to <a href="/tos">Telegram’s Terms of Service</a> and <a href="/privacy">Telegram’s Privacy Policy</a>. All of the aforementioned terms may be amended from time to time at our discretion, and updated versions enter into force as soon as they are published at their respective web-pages. </p>
<p>For clarity, your continued access to RS shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms and all other terms that are incorporated herein, including any updates or modifications to them from time to time.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="2-scope" href="#2-scope"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Scope</h3>
<p>Advertisers can use our <a href="https://ads.telegram.org/">Ad Platform</a> to purchase advertisements that will be published on Telegram in the form of sponsored messages. By default, ads are shown in public channels chosen by the advertiser. In return, channel owners may be eligible for rewards corresponding to a share of the revenue generated by the ads shown in their channel.</p>
<p>These terms govern your participation in RS, which is in no way to be viewed or represented as a form of employment or partnership with Telegram, nor as an endorsement by Telegram of you, your associates, agents, employers, channels, opinions, or the content you publish.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="3-availability" href="#3-availability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3. Availability</h3>
<p>The Telegram RS Program may not be available to certain channels, channel owners and geographical regions, in accordance with current demand, economic considerations, regulatory restrictions, channel topics and other factors. Similarly, advertisements may not be displayed to users in certain regions, which, at times, could represent a significant portion of your audience.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the RS Program for both you, your channels and your audience may change at any time, and we are not obligated to provide advance notice, compensation or explanations for any such changes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="4-rewards" href="#4-rewards"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Rewards</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-1-revenue-share" href="#4-1-revenue-share"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.1 Revenue Share</h4>
<p>You may be eligible to receive a reward corresponding to a 50% share of the revenue Telegram earns in connection with the number of valid impressions of sponsored messages displayed in eligible channels you own, subject to Telegram’s ongoing voluntary commitment to incentivizing content creators who comply with the terms set out in this agreement. The share, if any, is subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion.Telegram will determine the amount of your reward and means of withdrawal at its sole discretion.</p>
<p> You expressly acknowledge and agree that such rewards do not constitute payments for any services rendered, represent an optional good-faith effort by Telegram to incentivize content creators, and may be waived or discontinued at any time.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Telegram reserves the right to partially or fully withhold your rewards if it determines, at its sole discretion, that you have not been in compliance with these terms at any point, up to and including the date on which you request withdrawal. </p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that Telegram has the right to offset rewards to you by deducting any amount it deems related to invalid activity, impressions or queries. The deducted amount can equal the full balance as the case may be. Invalid activity includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Impressions and activity solicited through false representation, monetary purchase or explicit requests for users to interact with sponsored messages for the purposes of artificially inflating payout.</li>
<li>(b) Spam, automation, invalid or fake impressions and any other simulated or otherwise non-genuine activity, regardless of whether operated by you, your associates or other third parties.</li>
<li>(c) Any impressions or activity generated in a channel (or by a user) that itself did not comply with these Terms or, by extension, with the Telegram <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
<li>(d) Attempts to modify or interfere with Telegram clients and APIs, including but not limited to tampering with how Telegram serves ads and measures user impressions.</li>
<li>(e) Any other activity influenced by intentional or otherwise unwanted misconduct by the channel owner, its audience, other channel administrators or unrelated third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that any such invalid activity is detected after you have withdrawn your balance, Telegram reserves the right to debit your account and offset any future rewards until it is made whole. Depending on the circumstances and at its sole discretion, Telegram may also stop rewarding you based on the revenue originating from your channel, or terminate it and your account altogether.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-2-payment-of-rewards" href="#4-2-payment-of-rewards"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.2. Payment of Rewards</h4>
<p>Telegram currently outsources the payout of RS rewards to <a href="https://fragment.com/">Fragment</a>, a non-custodial platform owned and operated by Fragment Corp. You understand and agree that your engagement with Fragment is further subject to the Fragment <a href="https://fragment.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://fragment.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you understand that Fragment may be unable to facilitate reward withdrawal for certain users or in certain countries, in accordance with regulatory considerations and other factors. Likewise, your government or internet service provider may prevent you from accessing or engaging with Fragment. All aforementioned factors are outside of our control, therefore, should you be unable to withdraw your rewards through Fragment for any reason, you acknowledge and agree that Telegram will not be liable, nor will it offer any alternative reward.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-3-value" href="#4-3-value"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.3. Value</h4>
<p>When there are Toncoins or other cryptocurrencies in your channel balance, official Telegram clients may display an estimated value of your balance in a global currency, such as USD or EUR. You understand and agree that the estimated value displayed is for convenience only, is purely an approximation relevant for a particular moment in time and not a guaranteed price or exchange offer. The relative value of cryptocurrencies may fluctuate over time, and we make no guarantee that any cryptocurrency will retain or increase its value over time in relation to other global currencies.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-4-balance" href="#4-4-balance"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.4. Balance</h4>
<p>You understand and agree that the pending balance shown in your Telegram channel, until requested for withdrawal and successfully transferred, does not constitute funds owned by you and held in deposit or under custody by Telegram on your behalf. These displayed earnings should be considered an indicative amount representing the rewards you may receive pursuant to the provisions set out herein under our revenue sharing model. The Telegram platform is not and does not act as a financial institution or custodian of these funds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, without limiting <a href="#4-2-payment-of-rewards">4.2.</a>, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the timely withdrawal of your accrued rewards. We reserve the right to impose an expiration date on your unredeemed rewards at our sole discretion, after which they will be considered forfeit.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-5-account-management" href="#4-5-account-management"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.5. Account Management</h4>
<p>Channel owners and their administrators are solely responsible for safeguarding, handling and withdrawing any rewards earned by their channel from RS. By accepting these terms, you acknowledge that as the channel owner, you bear all responsibility therein, including but not limited to maintaining access to your Telegram account, enabling security features such as Two-Step Verification, using only official Telegram apps and ensuring your devices are free of malware.</p>
<p>For clarity, should you lose access to your account or channel, thereby becoming unable to withdraw any pending balance, that balance is considered forfeit and Telegram will not compensate you for this loss. Similarly, any reward withdrawals are neither reversible nor refundable, including but not limited to instances where you may erroneously withdraw money into an incorrect wallet. You understand that it is your responsibility to ensure that your withdrawals are set for the intended cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
<p>You additionally understand and agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring your continued ability to access your cryptocurrency wallet, and, by extension, any cryptocurrency you own. Neither Telegram nor any other party controls decentralized blockchains, and as such, there exists no mechanism, entity or authority capable of restoring access to your wallets or funds, should you lose access to them for any reason, including but not limited to negligence, malware, technical errors and malicious actors. You must take any necessary steps to safely store the login information, passwords, passphrases and other recovery information related to your wallet, and Telegram will not be liable if you fail to do so, or otherwise lose access to your wallet or funds by any means.</p>
<p>For clarity, you understand and agree that Telegram does not possess the technical means to restore your cryptocurrency wallet and will not refund you any cryptocurrency should you lose access to either one by any means or for any reason.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="4-6-taxes-and-fees" href="#4-6-taxes-and-fees"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4.6. Taxes and Fees</h4>
<p>You are solely responsible for all taxes and fees associated with the income you receive via RS, if applicable and in accordance with local laws. Telegram will not inform you of, nor calculate or pay out any taxes and fees on your behalf. All payouts you withdraw via RS are to be considered inclusive of tax. You explicitly acknowledge and agree that Telegram will not be liable for any fees, expenses, penalties, or additional costs you may incur as a result of your participation in RS, including but not limited to those arising from your failure to properly comply with applicable local laws.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="5-unilateral-termination" href="#5-unilateral-termination"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>5. Unilateral Termination</h3>
<p>Telegram can decide to fully or partially discontinue RS at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. This includes but is not limited to discontinuation in specific regions, for certain users or channels, or for a subset of services and features. For clarity, we make no guarantee of ongoing or continued support for this program. In the event that the program is terminated, any accrued rewards that have not been transferred out of a channel will remain accessible for a period determined at our sole discretion, after which it will be considered forfeit.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that Telegram has complete discretion to terminate your reward from or participation in RS without warning, for violations of these Terms or of the <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram Terms of Service</a> made by your channel, its administrators, or yourself. In such cases, Telegram may temporarily suspend your channel’s participation until the infraction is remedied, or permanently remove your channel from the RS program.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-liability" href="#6-liability"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6. Liability</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Telegram shall bear no liability for any unrealized payments, lost or misplaced cryptocurrency, or otherwise unforeseen consequences, financial or otherwise, that you may incur as a direct or indirect consequence of your present or past participation in the RS Program.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge and agree that Telegram has no liability, control, nor responsibility over the cryptocurrency wallets to which you withdraw your RS earnings. Your relationship with said wallets and their relevant service providers is governed by any applicable Terms of Service between you and the third-party services. Any disputes or concerns that may arise regarding your external cryptocurrency wallets and transfers are to be mediated and resolved solely by yourself and the third party services involved.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-1-indemnity" href="#6-1-indemnity"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.1. Indemnity</h3>
<p>You accept and agree to grant Telegram and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, contractors and employees absolute indemnity and to hold them harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, obligations, investigations, demands, suits, expenses, costs and damages (including but not limited to legal fees, fines or penalties imposed by any authorities, private entities or regulatory institutions) arising from, related to, or in any way incurred as a result of your use of, conduct in connection with, your engagement with, receipt of and access to the RS Program. For clarity, this indemnity clause complements the rights, privileges and protections already provided to us under the Telegram Terms of Service (if applicable).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="6-2-services-provided-as-is" href="#6-2-services-provided-as-is"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>6.2. Services Provided “As Is”</h3>
<p>We undertake all possible efforts to provide the best experience of participating in the RS. However, just like many other electronic services, the RS is provided &quot;as is” and “as available”, and we make no guarantees that the RS always will be error-free, or that it will function without delays and disruptions at all times. We disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="7-changes" href="#7-changes"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7. Changes</h3>
<p>We will review and may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes to these Terms will become effective when we post the revised Advertisement Revenue Sharing Terms of Service on this page <a href="www.telegram.org/tos/content-creator-rewards"><strong>www.telegram.org/tos/content-creator-rewards</strong></a>.
